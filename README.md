# Real Time Hand Gestures Recognition for Human Computer Interaction Using Deep Learning

Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Network-Project utilizing computer vision and image classification techniques

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system intended for real-time application. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our objective was to classify grayscale images of static hand gestures into one of ten predefined categories. This problem is relevant in the context of human-computer interaction, where touchless control through gestures offers both accessibility and intuitive user experiences. I used the leapGestRecog dataset, a publicly available collection of ten gesture types performed by multiple individuals. Later as a part of optimization and training, we manually added captured data for training model.
